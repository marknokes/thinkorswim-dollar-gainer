# Thinkorswim Dollar Gainer Scan
[This script](https://github.com/marknokes/thinkorswim-dollar-gainer/blob/main/scan.ts) allows you to scan stocks for net change in thinkorswim

Thinkorswim has a % change scan out of the box, but not a net change scan. Many traders like to use a dollar gainer or dollar loser scan in the pre-market for finding stocks to trad for the day. Full instructions for how to install the script can be found on the Trade For Me blog post, how to create a [thinkorswim (TOS) dollar gainer scan](https://tradeforme.money/trading/how-to-create-a-thinkorswim-tos-dollar-gainer-scan/)
